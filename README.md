# ComfyUI Open WebUI API 

This set of custom nodes enables you to access Ollama Models through the Open WebUI.

## Usage
To use this you will need to have Ollama set up with Open WebUI.  
Log into the web interface, go to your user settings and create an API Token. In Comfy UI Add this token to the Connection Node alongside with the IP and Port of Open WebUI (it should be the same as you need to access the web view).

If you have set up image generation in Open WebUI you can also use it through this connection.
